# Performance
Unlike the computer vision project, here there is not much data to train the neural network on, so I was able to train the neural network along a lot of epochs without any computational restrictions.

The neural network was able to achieve 100% of accuracy on the training data, which means it will be able to generate the corresponding response if the user's input will be as similar to the patterns the neural network was trained on.

* Accuracy: 43.25% -> 76.15%
* Loss: 1.5687 -> 0.6955
